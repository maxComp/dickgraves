It was on 3.5 arcres of land and had
these old trees and made a beautiful setting
for a home. And the home was designed to fit
in—into the property and around the trees,
and it was really and truly a lovely home, had
a full basement; we had a big recreation room
in the basement. It had the latest of everything
in it. <br><br>In fact, I was talking to my son the other
day, I said, “I see now they’re advertising real
strongly these heat pump systems, which is
actually an air conditioner in the summertime,
and then it provides heat in the wintertime.
This was a system I put in the house in 1948.
It was called a heat pump at that time, and it
was actually pretty much invented by a local
man. It worked reasonably well, but it hadn’t
been proved out yet. So later on we changed it
over to conventional heating system.” But—so
it only took twenty years for ’em to develop
and start selling it. [Chuckling] But we had
the first one that probably ever was around.
It was kind of a Mickey Mouse arrangement,
but it actually worked. But it did cause a lot of
problems, so I eventually took it out.<br><br>
What was the view like from that location?
Well, it looked off across to the mountains
clear across the valley and then you looked
down on the valley, the Boise Valley that went
down through. You looked right out over
Garden City. And, the only big problem with
it was that we had to run a taxi service for the
children because where we had been living
they could go anywhere on their bikes; here
they had to be taken because it was about—
oh— at that time it was three, four miles away
from any stores or churches or anything like
that, and now it’s right in the center of a big
living area, big residential area, I should say.
