<p>The original image of Last Chance Joe was designed in 1952 by 
 <a href="https://woodwardblog.com/2024/01/10/commercial-art-a-mini-history-lesson">Roscoe E. Duke Reading</a> of Boise Idaho.<br><br>
At that time,  Graves owned the Last Chance Cafe in Garden City, ID, an independent city in the NW part Boise. This image was used for several years in local advertising.<br><br>Wanting to take Last Chance Joe to another level, he sent Reading's sketches to Rempel Manufacturing. After some negotiations, Rempel earned the rights to sell the character in their "Little Folks from Sunnyslope" line. The character became one of the company's best-selling toys.

In September 1957, it was announced that a 35-foot-tall figure of Last Chance Joe would stand in front of one of Grave's new casinos, though the statue wound up only being 32 feet tall. The statue was shipped in three sections via a train car from the construction studio in California to its Nevada home.
<br><br>
Last Chance Joe's home was acquired by new owners in May 2014, and he was not part of their plans for improving the casino. But fortunately, the city of Sparks, Nevada, rallied to save their beloved cartoon icon. On December 2, 2014, the Sparks Museum installed the giant statue in front of its own building.
