 This little squatty
Indian, carved by Thane Robertson
from Boise was sort of an advertising gimmick
and theme for the Brunswick Cafe in Coeur
d'Alene and Sandpoint. <br><br>Thane carved the
Indian in Boise, and then it was flown to
Coeur d'Alene on Empire Airlines, and was
met by the secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce and Bill Webster, the manager,
and the managers of -- local managers of
the Empire Airlines. We had newspaper
stories on it at that time, and they allowed
Skookumchuck to fly up on -- at half fare.
