 I went on then at that point and put a
locker club in the Saratoga Hotel in Caldwell.
<br><br>I first started with a small place and then
enlarged it, put in a very elaborate dining
room called the Walnut Dining Room. It was
all a real wood walnut panelling, and did an
excellent business in a very small club which
we called the Saratoga Club in connection
with this dining room. <br><br>Later on, I don’t
know just what year, I bought the hotel and
actually operated the hotel, which was about
a sixty-room hotel—quite an old hotel.
