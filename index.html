Richard L. Graves (August 24, 1912 – January 12, 1990) was an American businessman from Boise, Idaho. He was known as a casino pioneer, promoting the use of slot machines as well as being involved in advertising. He died in Carson City, Nevada on January 12, 1990.<br><br>Graves started his casino management career in Idaho. While he was working for The Idaho Statesman newspaper writing for their education section, the editor found out that he was installing slot machines at a hotel. Though the editor wanted to keep Graves, he told Graves he would have to give up one of the jobs and Graves chose to keep installing slot machines. <br><br>Within six years of starting, he ran up to ten slot clubs in the state until December 1953 when the Idaho Supreme Court ruled that slot machines were to be banned in Idaho and Graves' permits were invalid. <br><br>Graves reacted by selling all of his premises in Idaho and moving to Nevada where he opened three clubs called "The Nugget" in Yerington, Carson City, and Reno within four months. Graves brought the majority of his employees from Idaho with him.
