 Dick Graves and Jim Kelley opened the Carson Nugget on March 1, 1954, in Carson City.<br><br> Dick Graves' Nugget was opened on March 17, 1955 in Sparks.<br><br>In 1960, John Ascuaga (1925-2021), then general manager, bought the Sparks Nugget. Ascuaga had little money when he purchased the small venue so he paid via loan, which he paid back in full within the number of years granted. <br><br>The Celebrity Showroom, first known as the Circus Room, was constructed in the 1960s and featured Liberace, Peggy Lee, Sergio Franchi, The Osmond Brothers, Robert Goulet, Red Skelton and others. <br><br>Construction began shortly thereafter and was completed December 26, 1984. Ascuaga deemed it one more Christmas present to the community and also deemed it an "exclamation point in the sky".<br><br>

The Nugget's primary attraction from, 1962 through the late 1990s, was Bertha the Elephant, who often entertained in the Circus Room. She was later joined by elephants Tina and Angel. They were also attractions at the annual Nevada Day parade in Carson City. Bertha died in 1999.  <br><br>A solid gold statue of a rooster in their Golden Rooster Room was seized by United States marshals in 1960, then returned in 1962, following a lawsuit.
