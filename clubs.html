 Two master licenses for machines were available in Boise. 
Me and 
Gem State Novelty operated by Harold
Pepple, got those licenses.
It got into a pretty big operation. We had
machines in Nampa, Caldwell, Emmett, all the
surrounding towns, and of course in Boise.<br><br> At
that time there was a club in the Hotel Boise,
a small club which was a locker club. Now a
locker club was where you brought your own
liquor into the store. You bought your liquor
at the state liquor store, you brought your own
bottle of whiskey into the club, and it was kept
in a small locker. You might have two, three,
four bottles of whiskey in the locker. <br><br>You and
your friends came in and had a drink. The
bartender went and got your bottle, served the
drink, charged a fifteen-twenty-cent service
charge. I had the machines in this Congress
Club, had four machines in the place, and they
did extremely well.
