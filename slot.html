 I had a friend that I used to run around
with-quite a bit with. He was my age and
his father had, had slot machines. For one
reason or another these fascinated me and
while my friend had no use for them at all, I
was anxious to try to get into the slot machine
business. <br><br>It looked pretty good to me. And I
found a location in a store which we, a bunch
of us kids, used to hang around. It was just a
little like a Seven-Eleven Store, a place of
that type. And I knew the owner, and asked
him if I could put a slot machine in. <br><br>Well, slot
machines were illegal, but they were tolerated
in those days in a lot of places. So, I talked to
the father of this boy and he said, "Yes." He'd
let me have one. So we put the machine in and
he kept the keys. I didn't have the keys and
he went away for a few days, and when he
came back the machine wasn't working. But
the reason it wasn't working, it was so full of
money it was plugged up. This was machine
Number One. <br><br>
Naturally, it looked extremely good to
me. So this went, well, from that machine
to another machine and into punch boards.<br><br>
After I got out of high
school I was still, of course, working at the
Statesman, in the office and in the collection
department. But I was gradually putting out
more and more machines.<br><br> About this time,
I built my own pinball machine. This was
when pinballs first came in. Did this in the
basement of my folks' house. I built it out of
mahogany, and, put it in Tillotson's Sporting
Goods store. operated it with the sporting
goods store and it made money for quite a
few years. Unfortunately, I lost this machine
somewhere along the line.
