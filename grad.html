 During high school I delivered the
morning newspaper on my bicycle. I had to
go clear downtown to get the papers at three
o'clock in the morning. I also started three
furnaces for older widows. This was in the
day before automatic furnaces of any type.<br><br>
I'd go in and get the fire started and stoke it
with coal so the house would be warm when
they got up. Well, by the time I got out of
high school, or graduated from high school,
I was route manager for the Statesman. And
after that I came to work in the office and
collection department. At that time the boys
who delivered the papers did so for a wage. They didn't do the collection, collectors went out and collected for the paper.
