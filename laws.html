In the Idaho Territory days of the mid-1800s, gambling was prominent in parts of Idaho. As the area inched closer to statehood, however, local officials began to crack down. In 1889, the original state constitution was written and ratified. Article III, Section 20 was noticeably vague about the legality of gambling in specific forms: “The legislature shall not authorize any betting or gift enterprise, under any pretense or for any purpose whatever.”

In 1947, the Idaho legislature caved to the popular trends of the day, legalizing “coin-operated amusement devices.
<br><br>
The state legalization of slot machines was a significant moment in Idaho legislative history. Several unincorporated communities took advantage of state incorporation laws “in order to bring slot machines into their newly formed municipalities” for the revenue. Garden City incorporated when Boise banned slot machines and Crouch incorporated a 10-mile stretch of a narrow, “one-foot-wide” section just to legalize slot machines at a specific roadhouse.

While slot machines saw widespread popularity in Idaho in the years immediately following WWII, their popularity was short-lived. In 1953, federal Judge Chase A. Clark declared Idaho’s 1947 slot machine law unconstitutional. Following the federal ruling, the Idaho legislature rescinded their 1947 law and banned slot machines, giving machine owners the option of “destroying them or shipping them to Nevada.”

By 1988, the state legislature caved to popular pressure and allowed the creation of a lottery onto the ballot, where it passed in the general election.
<br><br>
Although Idaho outlawed slot machines in the 1950s, the state legalized betting on horse racing in 1963. However, betting on horse racing has diminished with the legalization of the lottery, tribal casinos, and online gambling.
